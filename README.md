# Julia Floating-Point Precision Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to floating-point precision in Julia.  The `myfunction` function exhibits unexpected behavior when dealing with very small negative numbers due to the limitations of floating-point representation.

The bug is explained in detail within the `bug.jl` and `bugSolution.jl` files.
