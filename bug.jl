```julia
function myfunction(x)
  if x > 0
    return x^2
  else
    return -x
  end
end

println(myfunction(2))  # Output: 4
println(myfunction(-2)) # Output: 2

# This appears to work correctly, but introduces a subtle bug if x is close to 0:

x = 1e-10
println(myfunction(x))  # Output: 1e-20
println(myfunction(-x)) # Output: 1e-10

# For very small negative numbers, the 'else' branch (-x) will be slightly larger than the 'if' branch (x^2). 
# This isn't obvious for larger numbers but is relevant for small ones due to floating point precision limits.
